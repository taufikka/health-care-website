# Evercare Hospital

My project site link: (https://health-care-web.web.app/).

## Simple React Project

In the project, I try to build MPA using react-router, context api, firebase for authentication and used css framework bootstrap for responsive site.

### React Core Things

In the project, I used react core concepts JSX, Components, Props, Event, State, UseEffect and also used router, router hooks, custom hooks, context api etc. This project help me to learn more about routing pages using react.

### React authentication 

In the project, I try to authenticate users by two option. One is google login and another one is email,password login after sign up. I used firebase authentication approach.
I also do private route authentication for specific page.

### Context api and Custom hook

In the project, I used one custom hook for firebase authentication all approaches. Then lastly i used alternative of custom hook, context api for whole app control. Context api used custom hooks data and handle all code easily from app.

### My project Concepts and features

I try to build a simple react MPA based on health care related information. In my project, Header section shows navigation of four pages are home,about,contact,login. Header and Footer section is same for all pages.Body section will change depending on page switch. In home page, At first top section start with title and 
banner then there are some cards of eye disease treatment. When click any card read more button it will navigate to another page for more details. Details page is private route, after login user can show all details. Then in about page, doctor and hospital related details information is describe.In contact page, there is necessary option like email,phone-number,address for connect.Lastly for authentication login option here, user can use google for login or email password sign up. After user login their name will appear in header section. User when try to visit any page that does not exist site will show 404 error.

In future, I will try to add more features in site and update my MPA.
