        description: 'Lasik surgery is a procedure to correct refractive errors (focusing errors).The eye functions like a camera. Light rays entering the eye are focused by the cornea and the lens of the eye onto the light sensitive retina at the back of the eye, which is like the film of a camera. The retina then transmits a clear image, or photo to the brain. In people with refractive errors like myopia (nearsightedness)and hyperopia (farsightedness), the light rays are not focused properly and blurred images are formed. These can be measured as aberration patterns.'
